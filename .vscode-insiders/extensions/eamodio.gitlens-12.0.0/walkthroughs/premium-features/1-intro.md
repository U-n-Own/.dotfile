## Introducing Premium Features

Premium features are all-new features that enhance your current GitLens experience and require an account to access. Anyone can try premium features for public and private repos for 3 days, without an account.

The Visual File History and Worktrees premium features can be accessed with a GitLens Free+ account. Free+ accounts have to access premium features on public repos, while a paid account is required for private repos.

## More premium features coming soon

Additional premium features like a visual commit graph, and integrations for GitHub Enterprise and GitLab are coming soon.

## Does this affect existing features?

No, the introduction of premium features has no impact on existing GitLens features, so you won't lose access to any of the GitLens features you know and love. Creating an account simply gives you access to new premium features that will enable you to get even more out of Git in VS Code!

All non-premium features will continue to be free without an account.
